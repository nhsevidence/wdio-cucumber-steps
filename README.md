## Usage

First install via npm:

```sh
npm i @nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps --save-dev
```

Then assuming you have a *wdio.conf.js* that looks something like this:

```js
exports.config = {
    // Options missing here for brevity
    cucumberOpts: {
        require: [
            "./src/steps/index.js",
        ]
    }
};
```

Then import the following into *./src/steps/index.js* (or wherever your custom step definitions) are:

```js
import "@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/given";
import "@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/when";
import "@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/then";
```

The easiest way is to fork the [NICE frontend testing base](https://github.com/nhsevidence/frontend-testing-base/) as it comes with the required dependencies.

## Development

You can use ES6 and [Flow type definitions](https://flow.org/) when developing in the [src folder](src). The source is automatically transpiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/) into the lib folder when you [release](#releasing).

### Debug

You can use Given/Then/When/And followed by "I debug" within the feature file which stops the running browser and gives you time to jump into it and check the state of your application ([WDIO Help on Debug](http://webdriver.io/api/utility/debug.html)):

```sh
Given I debug
Then I debug
When I debug
And I debug
```

### npm linking

To dev locally, it can be useful to test these step definitions in context of real features. In this case, use [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) to symlink to another folder:

```sh
npm link
```

Then in your testing project:

```sh
npm link @nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps
```

Once they are all linked, run the following command to recompile the files as you make changes so that they are reflected in your test project:

```sh
npm run es5ify:watch
```

> Don't forget to unlink! `npm unlink @nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps`

## Releasing

We use [np](https://www.npmjs.com/package/np) for releasing. Run `npm run release` to release a patch version or `npm run release:minor` or `npm run release:major.` This will run tests, bump package.json version and create a git tag for you.

## Tests

### Running the tests

Run the following command to lint and run unit tests:

```sh
npm test
```

Or alternatively just run `npm run lint` or `npm run test:unit` individually. If you're devving and you've got eslint errors you need to fix, run `npm run lint:fix`.
