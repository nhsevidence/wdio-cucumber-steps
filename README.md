## v1 breaking changes

v0 targeted webdriverio v4. v1 targets wdio v6, so includes breaking changes. These v1 changes include:

- support files are now written in TypeScript and ship with type definitions, so you'll get TS intellisense
- all support files are now promise based, so you'll have to `await` them in your step definitions
- the support modules use named exports rather than default exports
- the support modules are TypeScript
- the `waitFor` module now only accepts `enabled`, `displayed` and `exist` as `state` (and not `checked`, `selected` etc)
- `globalnavLogin` is now `globalNavAccountsLogin`
- `submitForm` has been removed along with the corresponding `When I submit the form X` step definition
- the _src_ folder is no longer included in the published npm package, just the _lib_ folder
  - so change any `cucumberautocomplete.steps` paths inside your _.vscode/settings.json_ files to replace _src_ with _lib_

## Usage

First install via npm:

```sh
npm i @nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps --save-dev
```

Then assuming you have a _wdio.conf.js_ that looks something like this:

```js
exports.config = {
  // Options missing here for brevity
  cucumberOpts: {
    require: ['./src/steps/index.js'],
  },
};
```

Then import the following into _./src/steps/index.js_ (or wherever your custom step definitions) are:

```js
import '@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/given';
import '@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/when';
import '@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/then';
```

The easiest way is to fork the [NICE frontend testing base](https://github.com/nice-digital/frontend-testing-base/) as it comes with the required dependencies. Note: make sure you clone the Webdriverio v6 version of frontend testing base (and not v4!).

### VS Code integration

We recommend the [Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete#overview) for intellisense for step definitions.

Install the extension and configure by adding the following to _.vscode/settings.json_ in your testing application:

```diff
{
+    "cucumberautocomplete.steps": [
+        "node_modules/@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/given/definitions.js",
+        "node_modules/@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/when/definitions.js",
+        "node_modules/@nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps/lib/then/definitions.js",
+    ]
}
```

Note: in v0 these settings pointed to the src folder, but the src folder is no longer published to npm in v1.

## Development

The source files (in the _src_ directory) are written in TypeScript. This _src_ is automatically transpiled into the _lib_ folder when you [release](#releasing).

### Debug

You can use Given/Then/When/And followed by "I debug" within the feature file which stops the running browser and gives you time to jump into it and check the state of your application ([WDIO Help on Debug](http://webdriver.io/api/utility/debug.html)):

```sh
Given I debug
Then I debug
When I debug
And I debug
```

### npm linking

To dev locally, it can be useful to test these step definitions in context of real features. In this case, use [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) to symlink to another folder:

```sh
npm link
```

Then in your testing project:

```sh
npm link @nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps
```

Once they are all linked, run the following command to recompile the files as you make changes so that they are reflected in your test project:

```sh
npm run es5ify:watch
```

> Don't forget to unlink! `npm unlink @nice-digital/wdio-cucumber-steps`

## Releasing

We use [np](https://www.npmjs.com/package/np) for releasing. Run `npm run release:patch` to release a patch version or `npm run release:minor` or `npm run release:major.` This will run tests, bump package.json version and create a git tag for you. Or run `npm run release` for more fine grained control, for example `npm run release -- prepatch --tag=alpha --preview --any-branch`.

## Tests

### Running the tests

Run the following command to lint and run unit tests:

```sh
npm test
```

Or alternatively just run `npm run lint` or `npm run test:unit` individually. If you're devving and you've got eslint errors you need to fix, run `npm run lint:fix`.
